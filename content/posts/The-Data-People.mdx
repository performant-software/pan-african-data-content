The [People Explorer](https://www.panafricandata.org/en/search/people/) includes 1,700+ people who participated in events or organizations related to Pan-Africanism and Afro-Asian internationalism. 

We began with explicitly Pan-African events, like the Pan-African Congresses, but as we researched the individuals involved, we recognized that many were also connected to broader networks of activism. They inspired us to include Afro-Asian events as well, to avoid artificially foreclosing the wider solidarities that shaped anticolonialialism in the twentieth century. Limiting our scope to Pan-African events alone would have obscured the cross-regional collaborations that were central to the struggle for liberation. By tracing these overlapping networks we aim to show how Pan-Africanism was both a distinct movement and part of a larger, interconnected project of global decolonization. 

The people represented in the dataset have been found in conference proceedings, organization records, and secondary sources. When possible, we include gender, occupation, locations, organizations, events, and VIAF and Wikidata identifiers. We are in the process of rendering data on people's occupations into a controlled vocabulary to support faceted search, composing biographies for people for whom we have found sufficient sources, and changing our citations from references that directed users to a Zotero group to full citations available directly on the explorer's information panel and details pages.

While the [events](https://www.panafricandata.org/en/posts/the-data-events/) and [organizations](https://www.panafricandata.org/en/posts/the-data-organizations/) data have their own challenges, people presented even more. Transliteration of names varied among sources. Some individuals named in event documents haven't been found in other sources, and some used pseudonyms for their safety. People had relationships of different kinds to multiple places. The FairData object graph management framework that powers our database uses "Last Name" and "First Name" to manage names, a schema that is not universal to naming conventions across cultures. The difficulties are ontological, epistemological, and technical.   

Yet, we adapted. The primary display name corresponds with the transliteration or moniker that most frequently appears in sources. Our notes address particularities of naming, differences in transliteration, and pseudonyms. Notes also include relationships to other people, though we ultimately aim to represent those relationships within the database itself. We include any places we have connected to a person (birth place, where they studied, where they lived and worked, and diplomatic assignments). Bios offer narrative context for places, but in our next phase, we intend to disaggregate places to more clearly indicate people's relationships to them. And we created workarounds within the database to ensure names displayed according to cultural conventions on the frontend.  

As with events and organizations, we know the People Explorer hasn't captured all the people who belong in our dataset. We feel confident that we will continue to find more as our research continues. At the same time, we know that there are names we will likely never find and people for whom we will struggle to find details. Our project is inevitably constrained by factors beyond our control: what archives have chosen to preserve or scholars have chosen to study. Moreover, important knowledge exists outside of institutions — in oral tradition, family stories and genealogies, community memory, and living practice. 

By acknowledging the silences, we hope to make space for what is missing as well as what can be found — to recognize that every dataset is also an archive of absence. Our work, therefore, is not only to document but also to invite collaboration by encouraging others to share, correct, and expand what we know so that the history of Pan-Africanism can be told as fully and justly as possible and inform its present.
