The [People Explorer](https://www.panafricandata.org/en/search/people/) includes 1,700+ people who participated in events or organizations related to Pan-Africanism and Afro-Asian internationalism. The people represented in the dataset are based on conference proceedings, organization records, and secondary sources. When possible, we include gender, occupation, locations, organizations, events, and VIAF and Wikidata identifiers.

We are in the process of rendering data on occupations into a controlled vocabulary to support faceted search, composing biographies for people for whom we have found sufficient sources, and changing our citations from references that users to a Zotero group to full citations available directly on the People Explorer.
