The [Organizations Explorer](https://www.panafricandata.org/en/search/organizations/) includes 53 organizations that we have been able to verify as having existed, for which we have found at least one participant. These are certainly not all the organizations that contributed to Pan-Africanism. The diverse types of groups in the data set include student organizations, journals and periodicals, and other activist groups. In the future, we hope to have identified enough organizations that disaggregating them into specific categories through faceted search would make sense.

Organizations are the latest addition to our dataset, and they have proved harder to track than people and events. Many exist as single lines in proceedings or documents related to events, or in biographies of event participants. In rare cases, we have been able to find archival records, such as the Negro Association, Manchester, which has an extant subscription book of members, a treasure trove of 74 members, though many are hard to identify because a substantial number of records include an initial, rather than a full first name.

Like the inherent challenges of tracking events beyond the well-documented congresses and meetings, our organization data is uneven. These absences remind us of the fragility of the archival record and the visibility of African and Black diasporic life within it. The traces that remain — sometimes no more than a name, an acronym, or a passing mention — offer both frustration and revelation. Studying African diaspora histories means working within this tension: between what can be known and what resists recovery.

The Organizations Explorer is, therefore, both a resource and an invitation. We hope it inspires moments of recognition and curiosity — an aha that leads to further research, renewed attention to overlooked networks, and collective efforts to fill the gaps to the extent possible.
