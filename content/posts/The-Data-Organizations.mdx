The [Organizations Explorer](https://www.panafricandata.org/en/search/organizations/) includes 52 organizations that we have been able to verify, even if we have not been able to identify participants. We considered leaving out the ones without known participants but recognized that surfacing their names might lead to further research that could find individuals associated with them.

These are certainly not all the organizations that have contributed to Pan-Africanism. The diverse groups in the dataset include student organizations, journals and periodicals, political parties with international reach, and other activist groups. In the future, we hope to have identified enough organizations that disaggregating them into specific categories through faceted search would make sense.

Organizations are the latest addition to our dataset, and they have proved harder to track than people and events. Many exist as single lines in proceedings or documents related to events, or in biographies of event participants. In rare cases, we have been able to find archival records, such as the Negro Association, Manchester, which has an extant subscription book, a treasure trove of 74 members, though many are hard to identify because a substantial number of records include an initial, rather than a full first name. Yet, among them, we found a notable name: Jomo Kenyatta, who was in his early years of embracing anticolonialism and Pan-Africanism and would go on to be a leader in Kenya's independence movement and, eventually, its first president.

Like the inherent [challenges of tracking events](https://www.panafricandata.org/en/posts/The-Data-Events/) beyond the well-documented congresses and meetings, our organization data is uneven. These absences remind us of the fragility of the archival record and the visibility of African and Black diasporic life within it. The traces that remain — sometimes no more than a name, an acronym, or a passing mention — offer both frustration and revelation. Studying Pan-Africanism, like other diasporic and postcolonial histories, means working within this tension: between what can be known and what resists recovery.

The Organizations Explorer is, therefore, both a resource and an invitation. We hope it inspires moments of recognition and curiosity — an aha that leads to further research, renewed attention to overlooked networks, and collective efforts to fill the gaps to the extent possible.
