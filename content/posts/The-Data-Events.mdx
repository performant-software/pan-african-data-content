The Events Explorer contains data for 49 of the 68 events in our dataset. Finding reputable sources for the remaining events has been a challenge, a result of the fact that documentation of Pan-Africanism is spotty at best. If we have not been able to confirm at least one participant in an event, we have not made it discoverable through the Events Explorer. 

The tremendous variation in information we have found and confirmed about events largely depends on whether or not we have been able to find primary sources produced in conjunction with them. For example, we can identify 193 participants for the First Universal Races Congress held in London in 1911 and 296 participants in the 1955 Afro-Asian Conference (often simply called the Bandung Conference) because we found booklets and proceedings. Conversely, we have only found three participants for the American Continental Congress for Peace, which took place in Mexico City in 1949, and "Kouyate's Event" has no official name and just two participants — we only know it was hosted by Malian educator, activist, and journalist Tiemoko Garan Kouyaté in Paris in 1934. 

We debated leaving the events with less available information out of the Events Explorer, but doing so would have reproduced the very hierarchies of visibility that have long shaped the historiography of Pan-Africanism. To omit the fragmentary would center only the meetings that has been better documented — records largely produced, preserved, and circulated through colonial or Western institutions. Including the partial, the uncertain, and the under-documented acknowledges both the unevenness of the archive and the scope of what remains to be recovered.

Our aim, therefore, is not to present a closed or definitive account but to invite curiosity — to spark new research, encourage users to question why some events are well recorded and others are not, and to seek out sources that might fill those silences. The Events Explorer is a living resource: an entry point into a dispersed and incomplete record of global Black political thought, one that depends on collective effort to expand and reimagine.
