      The Pan-African Data Project emerged from an earlier project, The Power
      Players of Pan-Africanism, a collaboration between Roopika Risam, who was
      then an associate professor at Salem State University, and Jennifer
      Powers, an MEd candidate in English education. Powers was also
      participating in the Digital Scholars Program, an opportunity to pursue
      digital humanities research that Risam founded along with Salem State’s
      archivist Susan Edwards and digital initiatives librarian Justin Snow.


      Risam was broadly interested in developing digital humanities research
      tools to support students and researchers in Black diaspora studies, while
      Powers was invested in the pedagogical possibilities of data literacy,
      particularly for introducing high school students to topics and people
      underrepresented in K-12 curricula. Together, in fall of 2019, Risam and
      Powers hatched a plan for research, data collection and curation, and data
      modeling: create a dataset that identified events — conferences, meetings,
      symposia — related to Pan-Africanism and the people who took part in them.
      During the spring of 2020, they were joined by Hibba Nassereddine, also an
      MEd candidate in English education and Digital Scholars Program
      participant.

      Over the course of a year, Risam, Powers, and Nassereddine conducted
      extensive primary and secondary source research to identify Pan-African
      events and their participants. In doing so, they confronted many of the
      challenges inherent in working with data on understudied historical
      movements — such as incomplete archives, inconsistent records, and
      dispersed documentation across continents and languages. This exploratory
      phase also included early data visualization experiments using Google
      Sheets, Tableau, and Gephi to prototype ways of representing networks,
      timelines, and geographies of Pan-Africanism.


      Initially, the team hoped that network analysis would reveal new insights
      about the Pan-African Movement — perhaps identifying attendees of
      Pan-African events who had been overlooked, expanding the familiar
      narratives centered on figures like W. E. B. Du Bois and Kwame Nkrumah.
      However, when they generated the networks, the results largely reproduced
      what was already known, foregrounding the same celebrated figures.

    description: "The result of their work were datasets for 19 events committed to GitHub and a co-authored article, “Data Fail: Teaching Data Literacy with Digital Humanities,” in the Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy, voted 2nd runner up in the Digital Humanities 2020 awards. In addition to credit for their work on the project and the article, Powers and Nassereddine received graduate credit for independent studies, paid for by the districts where they were simultaneously student teaching.\_\n"
