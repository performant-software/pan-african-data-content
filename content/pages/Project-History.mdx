    description: >-
      The Pan-African Data Project emerged from an earlier project, The Power
      Players of Pan-Africanism, a collaboration between Roopika Risam, who was
      then an associate professor at Salem State University, and Jennifer
      Powers, an MEd candidate in English education. Powers was also
      participating in the Digital Scholars Program, an opportunity to pursue
      digital humanities research that Risam founded along with Salem State’s
      archivist Susan Edwards and digital initiatives librarian Justin Snow.


      Risam was broadly interested in developing digital humanities research
      tools to support students and researchers in Black diaspora studies, while
      Powers was invested in the pedagogical possibilities of data literacy,
      particularly for introducing high school students to topics and people
      underrepresented in K-12 curricula. Together, in fall of 2019, Risam and
      Powers hatched a plan for research, data collection and curation, and data
      modeling: create a dataset that identified events — conferences, meetings,
      symposia — related to Pan-Africanism and the people who took part in them,
      inspired by Risam's work developing The Global Du Bois digital humanities
      project. During the spring of 2020, they were joined by Hibba
      Nassereddine, also an MEd candidate in English education and Digital
      Scholars Program participant.

      Over the course of a year, Risam, Powers, and Nassereddine conducted
      extensive primary and secondary source research to identify Pan-African
      events and their participants. In doing so, they confronted many of the
      challenges inherent in working with data on understudied historical
      movements — such as incomplete archives, inconsistent records, and
      dispersed documentation across continents and languages. This exploratory
      phase also included early data visualization experiments using Google
      Sheets, Tableau, and Gephi to prototype ways of representing networks,
      timelines, and geographies of Pan-Africanism.


      Initially, the team hoped that network analysis would reveal new insights
      about the Pan-African Movement — perhaps identifying attendees of
      Pan-African events who had been overlooked, expanding the familiar
      narratives centered on figures like W. E. B. Du Bois and Kwame Nkrumah.
      However, when they generated the networks, the results largely reproduced
      what was already known, foregrounding the same celebrated figures.

In addition to credit for their work on the project and the article, Powers and Nassereddine received graduate credit for independent studies, paid for by the districts where they were simultaneously student teaching.\_\n"

  - title: Phase II (2022-2025)
    description: >-
      When Risam moved to Dartmouth in 2022, she wanted to build on the earlier
      team's work. The idea of identifying “power players” ultimately felt
      limiting for understanding the collective and relational nature of
      Pan-Africanism. Seeking new directions, Risam consulted Quinn Dombrowski,
      her collaborator on The Data-Sitters Club digital humanities project, who
      encouraged her to think differently about what the data might reveal.
      Could it show how participation, presence, and encounter shaped the
      movement in less visible ways? This conversation led Risam to reimagine
      the project, to see it not as a blunt instrument to produce definitive,
      quantitative conclusions but as an interactive resource to support further
      research, surface unfamiliar names, and invite new interpretations of
      Pan-African history. Through her Digital Ethnic Futures Lab at Dartmouth
      (now the Creative and Critical Data Studio, co-directed with Dartmouth
      professor Jacqueline Wernimont), Risam brought on additional students to
      help her expand the original datasets into a new one that included
      organizations for The Pan-African Data Project. Nyashazadshe Jongwe, Vy
      Nguyen, and Ore James added gender for participants, which was
      instrumental to highlighting the vital role of women in Pan-Africanism.
      All Dartmouth students were compensated for their contributions.

      Two fellowships that Risam held during the 2022-2023 academic year were
      significant for The Pan-African Data Project. Through the AADHum Scholars
      Program at the African American Digital Humanities Initiative at the
      University of Maryland, College Park, Risam had the opportunity to
      envision the future of the project, in conversation with Marisa Parham,
      Jeffrey Moro, and Andrew W. Smith. The folks at AADHum were particularly
      skilled at thinking through what the datasets could and could not show
      (and talked Risam out of some terrible ideas!). A fellowship at Cambridge
      Digital Humanities, at the University of Cambridge, was equally valuable.
      Risam greatly benefited from conversations with digital humanists Caroline
      Bassett, Leonardo Impett, and Siddharth Soni while there. She also had the
      opportunity to connect with Cambridge professor Rachel Leow, who was part
      of the Afro-Asian Networks Research Collective. They discussed the
      challenges of Risam's research on Pan-Africanism and Leow and her
      collaborators' work on Cold War internationalism — and the intersections
      of both movements. As a result, Afro-Asian Networks agreed to share their
      data for The Pan-African Data Project, to give it a new life beyond the
      term of their grant, funded by the UK's Arts and Humanities Research
      Council (AHRC). At Cambridge, Risam also met David Palfrey, a committed
      Wikipedian, who added the project's data to Wikidata, with the goal of
      helping diversify content on Wikipedia.

      To build the site, Risam partnered with Performant Software Solutions,
      which works with humanities scholars to build new tools for research and
      teaching. This decision was based on her long admiration for their
      commitment to creating open-source software. The Pan-African Data Project
      could adapt Performant's code, while supporting new features for the site
      that would be available to other scholars. Together, Risam, Jamie Folsom,
      Anindita Basu Sempere, Chelsea Giordan, Derek Leadbetter, Ben Silverman,
      and other Performant collaborators developed the site and interactive
      visualizations. Specific features for the site include timelines, data
      exports, browser-based saved searches, custom data visualization embeds in
      posts, and static-site deployment, all of which can be re-used. Dartmouth
      graduate students Lethokuhle Msimang and Mikayla Walker also worked with
      Risam to prepare the dataset for the backend FairData repository and to
      add Wikidata and VIAF identifiers. The current version of The Pan-African
      Data Project launched in October 2025.
