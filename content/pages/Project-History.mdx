    description: >-
      The Pan-African Data Project emerged from an earlier project, The Power
      Players of Pan-Africanism, a collaboration between Roopika Risam, who was
      then an associate professor at Salem State University, and Jennifer
      Powers, an MEd candidate in English education. Powers was also
      participating in the Digital Scholars Program, an opportunity to pursue
      digital humanities research that Risam founded along with Salem State’s
      archivist Susan Edwards and digital initiatives librarian Justin Snow.


      Risam was broadly interested in developing digital humanities research
      tools to support students and researchers in Black diaspora studies, while
      Powers was invested in the pedagogical possibilities of data literacy,
      particularly for introducing high school students to topics and people
      underrepresented in K-12 curricula. Together, Risam and Powers hatched a
      plan for research, data collection and curation, and data modeling: create
      a data set that identified events — conferences, meetings, symposia — from
      the Pan-Africanist Movement and the people who took part in them. During
      the Spring 2020, they were joined by Hibba Nassereddine, also an MEd
      candidate in English Education and Digital Scholars Program participant.

  - description: "Over the year, Risam, Powers, and Nassereddine undertook primary and secondary source research to find events and attendees, encountering the many problems inherent in working with data related to an understudied [something] [a project like this, give examples].. [also exploratory data viz] [coordinated work with Google Sheets and prototypes with Tableau & gephi.\_\n\nThe result of their work were datasets for 19 events committed to GitHub and a co-authored article, “Data Fail: Teaching Data Literacy with Digital Humanities.” in the Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy, voted 2nd runner up in the Digital Humanities 2020 awards. In addition to credit for their work on the project and the article, Powers and Nassereddine received graduate credit for independent studies, paid for by the districts where they were simultaneously student teaching.\_"

  - title: Phase II (2022-2025)
    description: "When Risam moved to Dartmouth College in 2022, she brought on additional students in her Digital Ethnic Futures Lab to expand the original data set, under The Pan-African Data Project. After all, the earlier notion of what it meant to be a “power player” wasn’t a useful frame and the broader title opened up possibilities to further data-driven explorations of Pan-Africanism behind our initial investigations.\_\n\nThrough two fellowships in 2022, one at Cambridge Digital Humanities at the University of Cambridge and one with the African American Digital and Experimental Humanities Initiative (AADHum) at the University of Maryland, Risam reimagined The Pan-African Data Project as [describe].\_\n\nDavid Palfrey - adding data sets to wiki data\_\n\nIn 2022-2023, Nyashazadshe Jongwe, Vy Nguyen, and Ore James proposed and began implementing gender codes for participants. From 2023-2025, Mikayla Walker and Lethokuhle Msimang contributed further research, identifying new names of participants and adding more information about people we had already identified. Msimang also composed descriptions for events and organizations in the dataset."
