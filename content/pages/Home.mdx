      the People Explorer may be slow to load for people with relationships with
      multiple places, particularly the Soviet Union, and geographic borders for
      the Soviet Union look irregular when zoomed in. We appreciate patience as
      we address how our API loads polygons from the database.

  - title: About Pan-Africanism
    description: >-
      Pan-Africanism emerged at the turn of the twentieth century as a global
      network of ideas, activism, and solidarity linking Africa and its
      diasporas. Its origins lay in early congresses — starting with the 1900
      Pan-African Conference in London — where women and men, as intellectuals
      and organizers, challenged imperial domination and articulated a shared
      vision of Black freedom. Since its beginnings, Pan-Africanism has
      developed into a dynamic political and cultural movement, uniting
      campaigns for racial equality, self-determination, and economic justice
      from the Caribbean and the Americas to Europe and the African continent.

  - title: About the Project
    description: >-
      The Pan-African Data Project brings together historical research and
      digital methods to trace the people, organizations, and events that have
      shaped Pan-Africanism over more than a century. Through data curation and
      visualization, the project highlights the global networks of Black
      liberation and solidarity that link Africa and its diasporas. Drawing on
      archival and scholarly sources, it offers searchable, interactive views —
      maps, tables, and timelines — that reveal the scope and connections of
      Pan-African collaboration across nations, movements, and generations.
