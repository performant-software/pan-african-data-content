      The Pan-African Data Project (PADP) brings together historical research
      and digital methods to trace the people, organizations, and events that
      shaped Pan-Africanism during the 20th century. Through data curation and
      visualization, the project highlights the global networks of Black
      liberation and solidarity that link Africa and its diasporas. Drawing on
      archival and scholarly sources, it offers searchable, interactive views —
      maps, tables, and timelines — that reveal the scope and connections of
      Pan-African collaboration across nations, movements, and generations. In
      addition to Pan-Africanist meetings during the first decades of the
      twentieth century, The PADP includes data from Afro-Asian internationalist
      events to reflect relationships that evolved between interconnected
      movements as the century progressed. As newly independent African states
      emerged mid-century, they developed continental Pan-African connections
      and engaged with Afro-Asian alliances and the Non-Aligned Movement to
      pursue shared goals of sovereignty, economic justice, and solidarity while
      resisting the influence of the U.S. and the Soviet Union, the competing
      blocs of the Cold War era. The PADP draws on extensive historical research
      documenting figures, organizations, and events related to Pan-Africanism.
      The dataset was developed from archival and scholarly materials.


      Primary source research includes conference proceedings, newspapers and
      periodicals, contemporary academic publications, and declassified
      government documents such as CIA files. Secondary source research
      incorporates books and journal articles on Pan-Africanism, as well as data
      shared by our partner, the Afro-Asian Networks project.


      If you are a descendant or family member of an individual represented in
      The PADP and have concerns about accuracy, representation, or context, you
      may request a review by contacting Roopika Risam. The project team
      evaluates all such requests in good faith, prioritizing privacy, dignity,
      and historical integrity.
