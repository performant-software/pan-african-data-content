      The Pan-African Data Project (PADP) brings together historical research
      and digital methods to trace the people, organizations, and events that
      have shaped Pan-Africanism since the late 19th century. Through data
      curation and visualization, the project highlights the global networks of
      Black liberation and solidarity that link Africa and its diasporas.
      Drawing on archival and scholarly sources, it offers searchable,
      interactive views — maps, tables, and timelines — that reveal the scope
      and connections of Pan-African collaboration across nations, movements,
      and generations. In addition to Pan-Africanist meetings during the first
      decades of the twentieth century, the PADP includes data from Afro-Asian
      internationalist events to reflect relationships that have evolved between
      interconnected movements. As newly independent African states emerged in
      the mid-twentieth century, they began developing continental Pan-African
      connections and engaged with Afro-Asian alliances and the Non-Aligned
      Movement to pursue shared goals of sovereignty, economic justice, and
      solidarity while resisting the influence of the U.S. and the Soviet Union,
      the competing blocs of the Cold War era. Since the end of the Cold War,
      Pan-Africanism has taken new shape. The PADP draws on extensive historical
      research documenting figures, organizations, and events related to
      Pan-Africanism. 


      Primary sources include conference proceedings, newspapers and
      periodicals, contemporary academic publications, and declassified
      government documents such as CIA files. Secondary sources incorporate
      books and journal articles on Pan-Africanism, as well as data shared by
      our partner, the Afro-Asian Networks project.


      If you are a descendant or family member of an individual in the PADP and
      have concerns about accuracy, representation, or context, you may request
      a review by contacting Roopika Risam at Dartmouth College. The project
      team evaluates all requests in good faith, prioritizing privacy, dignity,
      and historical integrity.

      The PADP website draws on Performant Studio, a suite of open-source
      technologies designed by Performant Software Solutions. The data is
      managed using Performant's FairData object graph management framework. The
      backend for the website uses TinaCMS, an open-source content management
      system. The PADP is proud to have partnered with Performant to develop new
      open-source components — including timelines, tabular data views, faceted
      search, data exports, browser-saved searches, data vizualization embeds in
      posts, and static deployment to Reclaim Hosting — which can be reused in
      other digital projects.
