      The Pan-African Data Project (PADP) brings together historical research
      and digital methods to trace the people, organizations, and events that
      shaped Pan-Africanism during the 20th century. Through data curation and
      visualization, the project highlights the global networks of Black
      liberation and solidarity that link Africa and its diasporas. Drawing on
      archival and scholarly sources, it offers searchable, interactive views —
      maps, tables, and timelines — that reveal the scope and connections of
      Pan-African collaboration across nations, movements, and generations. The
      PADP includes data from both Pan-Africanist and Afro-Asian
      internationalist events to reflect the evolving relationships between
      these interconnected movements. As newly independent African states
      emerged in the mid-twentieth century, they developed continental
      Pan-African connections while also engaging with Afro-Asian alliances and
      the Non-Aligned Movement to pursue shared goals of sovereignty, economic
      justice, and solidarity outside the competing power blocs of the era.
      Including data from both contexts highlights how Pan-Africanism maintained
      a distinct focus on unity within Africa even as it contributed to a
      broader global project of decolonization and international cooperation.
      The Pan-African Data Project draws on extensive historical research
      documenting figures, organizations, and events related to Pan-Africanism
      between 1900 and 1960. The dataset is built from publicly available
      archival and scholarly materials and does not include personally
      identifiable information about living individuals.


      Primary source research includes conference proceedings, newspapers and
      periodicals, contemporary academic publications, and declassified
      government documents such as CIA files. Secondary source research
      incorporates books and journal articles on Pan-Africanism, as well as data
      shared by our partner, the Afro-Asian Networks Project.


      All data are presented for educational and research purposes. If you are a
      descendant or family member of an individual represented in the dataset
      and have concerns about accuracy, representation, or context, you may
      request a review through the contact information provided below. The
      project team evaluates all such requests in good faith, prioritizing
      privacy, dignity, and historical integrity.
