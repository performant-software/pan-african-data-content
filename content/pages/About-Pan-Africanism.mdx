      Pan-Africanism emerged at the turn of the twentieth century as a global
      network of ideas, activism, and solidarity linking Africa and its
      diasporas. Its origins lay in early gatherings — beginning with the 1900
      Pan-African Conference in London — where men and women alike, as
      intellectuals and organizers, challenged imperial domination and
      articulated a shared vision of Black freedom (Geiss 1974). Across the
      decades that followed, Pan-Africanism developed into a dynamic political
      and cultural movement, uniting campaigns for racial equality,
      self-determination, and economic justice from the Caribbean and the
      Americas to Europe and the African continent (Adi and Sherwood 2003).


      Figures such as W. E. B. Du Bois, Kwame Nkrumah, George Padmore, and
      Nnamdi Azikiwe shaped the political and philosophical dimensions of
      Pan-Africanism alongside women whose intellectual and organizing work was
      equally foundational. Amy Ashwood Garvey, Jeanne Martin Cissé, Alice
      Kinloch, and Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti, among others, advanced Pan-African
      thought through leadership in anti-colonial movements, women’s
      associations, trade unions, and international diplomacy. Scholars have
      illuminated how these women’s activism and intellectual production
      expanded Pan-Africanism’s scope and connected it to Black feminist and
      diasporic networks (Reddock 2007; Blain 2018; Sheldon 2020). These women's
      writings, speeches, and organizing articulated visions of solidarity that
      linked gender equality to racial and national liberation, broadening the
      very meaning of freedom the movement pursued.


      By mid-century, Pan-Africanism converged with broader currents of global
      liberation. Its principles resonated in the 1955 Bandung Conference, which
      brought together newly independent Asian and African nations to assert a
      Third World solidarity against colonialism and Cold War imperialism (Lee
      2019). The ideas forged at Bandung helped lay the foundations for the
      Non-Aligned Movement, formally established in 1961, which united
      postcolonial states seeking to assert autonomy as the U.S. and the Soviet
      Union attempted to expand their spheres of influence during the Cold War
      (Dinkel 2018).
