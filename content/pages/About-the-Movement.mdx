      This section provides historical context for Pan-Africanism and its global
      networks of activism, thought, and solidarity.


      Pan-Africanism emerged at the turn of the twentieth century as a global
      network of ideas, activism, and solidarity linking Africa and its
      diasporas. Its origins lay in early congresses—beginning with the 1900
      Pan-African Conference in London—where intellectuals and organizers
      challenged imperial domination and articulated a shared vision of Black
      freedom.\[^1] Across the decades that followed, Pan-Africanism developed
      into a dynamic political and cultural movement, uniting campaigns for
      racial equality, self-determination, and economic justice from the
      Caribbean and the Americas to Europe and the African continent.\[^2]


      Figures such as W. E. B. Du Bois, Kwame Nkrumah, George Padmore, and
      Nnamdi Azikiwe shaped the political and philosophical dimensions of
      Pan-Africanism alongside women whose intellectual and organizing work was
      equally foundational. Amy Ashwood Garvey, Jeanne Martin Cissé, Alice
      Kinloch, and Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti advanced Pan-African thought through
      leadership in anticolonial movements, women’s associations, trade unions,
      and international diplomacy.\[^3] Their writings, speeches, and activism
      articulated visions of solidarity that linked gender equality to racial
      and national liberation, broadening the very meaning of freedom the
      movement pursued.


      By mid-century, Pan-Africanism converged with broader currents of global
      liberation. Its principles resonated in the 1955 Bandung Conference, which
      brought together newly independent Asian and African nations to assert a
      Third World solidarity against colonialism and Cold War imperialism.\[^4]
      Pan-African intellectuals and activists also participated in Afro-Asian
      Writers’ Conferences and other forums where anticolonial thought
      circulated through literature, art, and political theory.\[^5] As African
      nations won independence, Pan-African ideals took new institutional
      form—embodied in movements for continental unity, from the Casablanca and
      Monrovia blocs to the founding of the Organization of African Unity in
      1963.\[^6]


      In this wider context, Pan-Africanism was more than a call for continental
      unity; it was a philosophy of relation that connected struggles across
      oceans and ideologies. It inspired visions of a decolonized world built on
      equality, cooperation, and shared humanity—ideals that continue to animate
      global movements for racial and social justice today.
