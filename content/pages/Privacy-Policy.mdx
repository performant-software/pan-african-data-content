      We value your privacy. This page describes how The Pan-African Data
      Project handles data from visitors to the site.


      **Last updated: October 15, 2025**


      ### 1. Who We Are


      The Pan-African Data Project is a digital humanities research initiative
      directed by Roopika Risam at Dartmouth College, developed in collaboration
      with the African American Digital Humanities Initiative (AADHum) at the
      University of Maryland, College Park; Performant Software Solutions; and
      student researchers.


      Our website address is
      [https://panafricandata.org](https://panafricandata.org).


      ### 2. What Data We Collect


      We collect only the data necessary to maintain the site and improve
      usability.


      #### Automatically collected information


      When you visit this site, standard web logs may record:


      * Browser type and version;

      * Device type and operating system;

      * Referring website;

      * Date and time of access; and/or

      * IP address (used for security and analytics only).


      This data is collected in aggregate and is not used to identify individual
      visitors.


      #### User accounts


      Individuals who wish to contribute content — such as
      [paths](https://www.panafricandata.org/en/paths/),
      [posts](https://www.panafricandata.org/en/posts/), or data — may request a
      user account through the contact information below. Account requests are
      reviewed and approved by the project team.


      When an account is created, we collect limited personal information (such
      as name, email address, and institutional affiliation) to verify identity
      and manage access.

      User credentials are stored securely and used only for authentication and
      project-related communication.


      #### Historical data


      The data presented on this site documents historical figures,
      organizations, and events related to the Pan-African Movement between 1900
      and 1960. It does not include personally identifiable information about
      living individuals.

      All research materials are derived from publicly available archival or
      scholarly sources and are presented for educational and research purposes
      only.


      If you are a descendant or family member of a person represented on the
      site and have concerns about accuracy, representation, or context, you may
      request a review of the relevant material through the contact information
      below. The project team will evaluate all such requests in good faith,
      prioritizing considerations of privacy, dignity, and historical integrity.


      #### Embedded and hosted content


      The Pan-African Data Project is hosted through Netlify, which may collect
      basic analytics data (such as browser type, referring site, and general
      location) as part of its standard hosting services. These analytics are
      anonymized and used only to monitor aggregate site traffic and
      performance.


      Some pages may include embedded media, such as images or videos, which
      behave as if you visited the source site directly and may collect data
      according to that site’s privacy policy.


      We do not control or store any information collected by Netlify or other
      third-party hosts.


      #### Voluntarily provided data


      If you contact the project team by email or through a contact form, we
      collect only the information you provide (such as your name and email
      address) in order to respond to your inquiry.


      #### Saved searches and data export


      This site allows visitors to save searches or export search results as
      JSON files. Please note: 


      * Saved searches are stored locally in your web browser and are not
      transmitted to or stored by The Pan-African Data Project; 

      * Saved searches are automatically deleted when you clear your browser
      cache or local storage; and

      * When you export data, the resulting JSON file is created on your device
      and is not sent to our servers.


      These features are provided solely for user convenience and do not
      transmit any personal information to the project.


      ### 3. Cookies 


      This site uses essential cookies to:


      * Ensure that the website functions properly;

      * Store Saved Searches in your browser; and

      * Support secure login functionality for authorized users.


      We do not use cookies for tracking, advertising, or marketing.


      By continuing to use this site, you consent to the use of essential
      cookies.


      ### 4. How We Use Data


      We use collected data to:


      * Maintain website security and functionality;

      * Manage user authentication and access for approved contributors;

      * Monitor aggregate site usage; and

      * Respond to visitor inquiries.


      We do not use visitor data for profiling, marketing, or commercial
      purposes.


      We do not sell or share your data with third parties.


      ### 5. Data Sharing and Retention


      Technical data collected through Netlify’s hosting platform is stored
      securely and retained only as long as necessary for the site’s operation.


      User account information is retained only while the account remains active
      and is deleted upon request or project completion.


      Contributors may request deletion of their accounts and associated
      personal data at any time. However, public content created through these
      accounts — such as [paths](https://www.panafricandata.org/en/paths/),
      [posts](https://www.panafricandata.org/en/posts/), or other contributions
      — may remain on the site as part of the project’s scholarly and archival
      record.


      Requests for content removal will be reviewed individually, prioritizing
      privacy, attribution, or ethical concerns.


      ### 6. Your Rights


      If you are located in the European Union, United Kingdom, or other
      jurisdictions with similar privacy laws, you may request:


      * Access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal data;

      * Information on how your data is processed; and

      * To withdraw consent at any time.


      To make such a request, contact us using the information below.
