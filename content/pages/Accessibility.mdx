      The Pan-African Data Project is committed to making its research and
      visualizations accessible to as many users as possible. The site is still
      in active development, and some visualizations may not display or function
      correctly on mobile devices or tablets due to the screen space required to
      present complex data.


      We are working to improve accessibility across platforms, including layout
      responsiveness, keyboard navigation, and screen-reader compatibility.


      If you encounter barriers to accessing the site or its content, please
      contact Project Director [Roopika
      Risam](mailto\:roopika.risam@dartmouth.edu). Feedback from users is
      essential to ensuring that this project remains open and inclusive.
