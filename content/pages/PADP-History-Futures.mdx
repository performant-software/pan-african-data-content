  - title: Phase I (2019-2022)
    description: >-
      The Pan-African Data Project emerged from an earlier project, The Power
      Players of Pan-Africanism, a collaboration between Roopika Risam, who was
      then an associate professor at Salem State University, and Jennifer
      Powers, an MEd candidate in English education. Powers was also
      participating in the Digital Scholars Program, an opportunity to pursue
      digital humanities research that Risam founded along with Salem State’s
      archivist Susan Edwards and digital initiatives librarian Justin Snow.


      Risam was broadly interested in developing digital humanities research
      tools to support students and researchers in Black diaspora studies, while
      Powers was invested in the pedagogical possibilities of data literacy,
      particularly for introducing high school students to topics and people
      underrepresented in K-12 curricula. Together, in fall of 2019, Risam and
      Powers hatched a plan for research, data collection and curation, and data
      modeling: create a dataset that identified events — conferences, meetings,
      symposia — related to Pan-Africanism and the people who took part in them,
      inspired by Risam's work developing The Global Du Bois digital humanities
      project. During the spring of 2020, they were joined by Hibba
      Nassereddine, also an MEd candidate in English education and Digital
      Scholars Program participant.

      Over the course of a year, Risam, Powers, and Nassereddine conducted
      extensive primary and secondary source research to identify Pan-African
      events and their participants. In doing so, they confronted many of the
      challenges inherent in working with data on understudied historical
      movements — such as incomplete archives, inconsistent records, and
      dispersed documentation across continents and languages. This exploratory
      phase also included early data visualization experiments using Google
      Sheets, Tableau, and Gephi to prototype ways of representing networks,
      timelines, and geographies of Pan-Africanism.


      Initially, the team hoped that network analysis would reveal new insights
      about the Pan-African Movement — perhaps identifying attendees of
      Pan-African events who had been overlooked, expanding the familiar
      narratives centered on figures like W. E. B. Du Bois and Kwame Nkrumah.
      However, when they generated the networks, the results largely reproduced
      what was already known, foregrounding the same celebrated figures.

    description: "The results of their work included datasets for 19 events committed to GitHub and a co-authored article, “Data Fail: Teaching Data Literacy with Digital Humanities,” published in the Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy in 2020. The article was voted 2nd runner up in the Digital Humanities 2020 awards. In addition to credit for their work on the project and the article, Powers and Nassereddine received graduate credit for independent studies, paid for by the districts where they were simultaneously student teaching.\_\n"

  - title: Phase II (2022-2025)
    description: >-
      When Risam moved to Dartmouth in 2022, she wanted to build on the earlier
      team's work. The idea of identifying “power players” ultimately felt
      limiting for understanding the collective and relational nature of
      Pan-Africanism. Seeking new directions, Risam consulted Quinn Dombrowski,
      her collaborator on The Data-Sitters Club project, who encouraged her to
      think differently about what the data might reveal. Could it show how
      participation, presence, and encounter shaped the movement in less visible
      ways? This conversation led Risam to reimagine the project, to see it not
      as a blunt instrument to produce definitive, quantitative conclusions but
      as an interactive resource to support further research, surface unfamiliar
      names, and invite new interpretations of Pan-African history. She began
      planning for an interactive website that would allow researchers or anyone
      interested in Pan-Africanism to explore the data. Through her Digital
      Ethnic Futures Lab at Dartmouth (now the Creative and Critical Data
      Studio, co-directed with Dartmouth professor Jacqueline Wernimont), Risam
      brought on additional students to help her expand the original datasets
      into a new one that included organizations for The Pan-African Data
      Project (PADP). Nyashazadshe Jongwe, Vy Nguyen, and Ore James added gender
      for participants, which was instrumental to highlighting the vital role of
      women in Pan-Africanism. All Dartmouth students were compensated for their
      contributions.

      Two fellowships that Risam held during the 2022-2023 academic year were
      significant for The PADP. Through the AADHum Scholars Program at the
      African American Digital Humanities Initiative at the University of
      Maryland, College Park, Risam had the opportunity to envision the future
      of the project, in conversation with Marisa Parham, Jeffrey Moro, and
      Andrew W. Smith. The folks at AADHum were particularly skilled at thinking
      through what the datasets could and could not show, and what
      visualizations might do (and talked Risam out of some terrible ideas!). A
      fellowship at Cambridge Digital Humanities, at the University of
      Cambridge, was equally valuable. Risam greatly benefited from
      conversations with Caroline Bassett, Leonardo Impett, and Siddharth Soni.
      She also connected with Cambridge professor Rachel Leow, who was part of
      the Afro-Asian Networks Research Collective. They discussed the challenges
      of Risam's research on Pan-Africanism and Leow and her collaborators' work
      on Cold War internationalism — and the intersections of both movements. As
      a result, Afro-Asian Networks agreed to share their data for The PADP, to
      give it a new life beyond the term of their grant, funded by the UK's Arts
      and Humanities Research Council (AHRC). At Cambridge, Risam also met David
      Palfrey, a committed Wikipedian, and they discussed strategies for linked
      open data. Palfrey later added the project's data to Wikidata, with the
      goal of helping diversify content on Wikipedia.

      To build The PADP's website, Risam partnered with Performant Software
      Solutions, which works with humanities scholars to build tools for
      research and teaching. This decision was based on her long admiration for
      their commitment to open-source software. The PADP could adapt
      Performant's code and support new features for the site that would be
      available to other scholars. Risam worked with Jamie Folsom, Anindita Basu
      Sempere, Chelsea Giordan, Derek Leadbetter, Ben Silverman, Rebecca Black,
      and Camden Mecklem to develop the site and interactive visualizations.
      Specific features for the site include timelines, data exports,
      browser-based saved searches, custom data visualization embeds in posts,
      and static-site deployment, all of which can be re-used. Dartmouth
      graduate students Lethokuhle Msimang and Mikayla Walker collaborated with
      Risam to prepare the dataset for the backend FairData repository and to
      add Wikidata and VIAF identifiers. Risam also consulted with historian
      Amara Thornton of the Beyond Notability project on site development. The
      current version of The PADP launched in October 2025.

  - title: Future Plans for PADP
    description: >-
      The PADP is an evergreen project, with new data continually added to the
      Events, People, and Organizations Explorers. We aim to increase
      granularity in the People Explorer by identifying individuals’
      relationships to places, distinguishing between observers, delegates, and
      members of the press, and indicating connections among people. Planned
      improvements include enhanced faceted search — adding occupations and
      distinguishing among Pan-African, Afro-Asian, and Non-Aligned Movement
      events — as well as linking events with relevant organizations. Future
      expansions include Explorers for periodicals and educational institutions
      connected to Pan-Africanism. We have more substantial plans that would
      require extramural funding, but this project is ineligible for federal
      grants in the U.S., where we are based, because of the Trump
      Administration's restrictions on funding for research that engages
      questions of race, colonialism, and historical inequity. We remain
      committed to sustaining and expanding the project through institutional
      partnerships and independent support, and we welcome collaborations.
