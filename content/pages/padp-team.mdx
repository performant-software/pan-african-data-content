      From its inception in 2019, the Pan-African Data Project has been led by
      Roopika Risam and shaped by many hands — a collaborative effort among
      scholars, students, and technologists working to document the networks of
      Pan-Africanism. A narrative description of contributions from the team is
      available on our History & Futures page.
