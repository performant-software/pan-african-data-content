      Paths advance through a sequence of locations to tell a connected story.
      Each waypoint presents new text and shifts the map view, guiding users
      through a narrative that unfolds step by step. One moment or place leads
      naturally to the next within a spatial narrative. 


      [Links](https://panafricandata.org), images,  audio-visual assets,
      flowcharts, code blocks, and tables can be incorporated into Paths as
      well. Editing is easy, with options for both Rich Text and Markdown
      editors.

      Paths can also be used for research, allowing scholars to create spatial
      narratives grounded in data from the Explorers. Each waypoint represents a
      place related to key events, people, or organizations in the database. The
      Paths functionality supports exploratory analysis and narrative
      presentation, helping researchers visualize how connections unfold across
      geography and temporality. To use Paths for research, please contact
      [Roopika Risam](mailto\:roopika.risam@dartmouth.edu).

      Paths can be used for class assignments or projects to help students
      visualize connections across space and time. The feature encourages
      comparative thinking and discussion — how ideas, movements, and people
      travel between places — and supports critical engagement with patterns of
      connection and change. To incorporate Paths into a course, please contact
      [Roopika Risam](mailto\:roopika.risam@dartmouth.edu).

Paths trace stories across time and space. Using places from the Explorers, creators can build narratives to show how people, movements, and ideas travel. This Path demonstrates how the functionality supports storytelling and serves teaching and research.
