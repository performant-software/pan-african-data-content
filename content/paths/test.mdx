      Paths advance through a sequence of locations to tell a connected story.
      Each waypoint presents new text and shifts the map view, guiding users
      through a narrative that unfolds step by step. One moment or place leads
      naturally to the next within a spatial narrative.

      Paths can also be used for research, allowing scholars to create spatial
      narratives grounded in data from the Explorers. Each waypoint represents a
      place where key events, people, or organizations intersect. The Paths
      functionality supports exploratory analysis and narrative presentation,
      helping researchers visualize how connections unfold across geography and
      time. To use Paths for research, please contact [Roopika
      Risam](mailto\:roopika.risam@dartmouth.edu).

      Paths can be used for class assignments or projects to help students
      visualize connections across geography and time. The feature encourages
      comparative thinking and discussion — how ideas, movements, and people
      travel between places — and supports critical engagement with patterns of
      connection and change. To incorporate Paths into a course, please contact
      [Roopika Risam](mailto\:roopika.risam@dartmouth.edu).

Paths offer an interactive way to trace stories that unfold across time and space. A Path can link places from the database to follow how movements, exchanges, and ideas travel. This Path demonstrates how the functionality can guide storytelling, illustrate transformation, and serve as a teaching and research tool.
