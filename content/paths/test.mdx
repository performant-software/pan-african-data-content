      Paths advance through a sequence of locations to tell a connected story.
      Each waypoint presents new text and shifts the map view, guiding users
      through a narrative that unfolds step by step. One moment or place leads
      naturally to the next within a spatial narrative.

    blurb: >
      Paths highlight smooth transitions between points to convey change over
      time and space. As users move along the route, the text and map update
      together. The Path functionality supports exploration of movement,
      transformation, and historical sequence within a single view.

    blurb: >
      Paths can be used for class assignments or projects to help students
      visualize connections across geography and time. The feature encourages
      comparative thinking and discussion — how ideas, movements, and people
      travel between places — and supports critical engagement with patterns of
      connection and change. To incorporate Paths into a course, please contact

The Path functionality allows users to explore stories that unfold across time and space. Path can connect events, organizations, people, and places, showing how movements, exchanges, and influences travel through geography and history. As users move along the path, the map and accompanying text update together, guiding them through a narrative sequence.
