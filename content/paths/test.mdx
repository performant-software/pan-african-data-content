      In July 1900, Du Bois traveled to London to take part in the First
      Pan-African Conference, the gathering that introduced the term Pan-African
      to global politics. Organized by Trinidadian lawyer Henry Sylvester
      Williams, the meeting brought together more than thirty delegates from
      Africa, the Caribbean, the United States, and Britain to protest colonial
      rule and racial discrimination. Du Bois delivered the conference’s closing
      address, “To the Nations of the World,” which called for an end to
      European exploitation in Africa and declared, “The problem of the
      twentieth century is the problem of the color line.” His words helped
      define the moral and political vision that would guide Pan-Africanism for
      decades to come.

The Path functionality allows users to explore stories that unfold across time and space. Path can connect events, organizations, people, and places, showing how movements, exchanges, and influences travel through geography and history. As users move along the path, the map and accompanying text update together, guiding them through a narrative sequence.
